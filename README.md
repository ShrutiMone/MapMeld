# MapMeld India: Synthesising Spatial Data for Actionable Insights

MapMeld is a tool designed for *comparing different types of maps*, like those showing national weather, forest, and species distribution data, which helps to compare various Indian maps by overlaying them.

MapMeld overlays two or more maps such that the user can view all with equal opacity to notice the relative placement of various objects present in all the maps. This can be used for understanding and analysing trends and correlations across several biodiversity factors.
